How did the unknown manifest in terms of the gas, its use and in its mitigation? All these questions to be discussed within the context of Bhopal and gas leak in Union Carbide factory. In your discussion, begin with a definition of unknown and its relationship with technology (innovation and use.) Include a discussion of risk and risk tolerance with respect to unknowns and technological use in different cultural settings. Then identify the conditions (social, political, economic etc.,) in which unknown is acceptable. Is it acceptable to institute technology when there are so many unknowns? How would the Amish’s perspective inform in the analysis of this case?</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_20000000000014/attachments/72067999/uofu_canvas_mobile.js\"></script>",

Their strategy for negotiations focused on a fixed settlement that would allow them to walk away from Bhopal and its victims. What moral responsibility did UCIL (and UCC) have towards the Bhopal victims? What systems need to be in place to prevent corporations such as UCC from \"walking away\" from catastrophes such as these?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>OR</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>2</strong>. Almost all ethical issues raised by new technologies are related in one way or another to questions of risk.  Answer the following questions based on the Bhopal gas leak case: Are the risks of a new technology predictable? How large are the risks and are they reversible? Are the benefits worth the potential risks, and who should decide? Do those persons on whom the risks will fall know about the risk and have they consented to bear these risks? Will they be justly compensated for their losses? Are the risks fairly distributed among various parts of society including poor and rich, young and old, future and present generations?</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads-2.s3.amazonaws.com/account_20000000000014/attachments/72067999/uofu_canvas_mobile.js\"></script>",
